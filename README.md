# Markov Chain 

This priject is a part of the C/C++ Programming Workshop at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, focusing on generic programming, pointers, and memory management.
the purpose if this project is to implement a generic Markov chain structure that handles different types of data and implementing two specific programs that utilize this generic structure:
1. Tweet Generator: Generates tweets using a Markov Chain.
2. Snakes and Ladders: A game simulation using the Markov Chain to create random paths in the game.
   
Key Concepts:
Generic Programming: Writing code that can operate on different data types.
Markov Chain: A library that predicts the next element in a sequence based on the current state.
Memory Management: Efficiently managing memory allocation and deallocation using pointers.

Files Provided:
markov_chain.h: Header file containing the structure of the Markov Chain with support for generic types.
markov_chain.c: The implementation of the Markov Chain functions.
tweets_generator.c: A program that generates tweets based on the Markov Chain.
snakes_and_ladders.c: A game simulation using the Markov Chain for generating random game paths.
linked_list.h, linked_list.c: A linked list implementation used in the project.
justdoit_tweets.txt: Input file for the Tweet Generator program.
makefile: For compiling both the Tweet Generator and Snakes and Ladders programs.
